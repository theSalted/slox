[![Swift](https://github.com/theSalted/slox/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/theSalted/slox/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

Yet another Swift Implementation of a Lox Interpreter.

This project follows the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) written by [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob).

> [!NOTE]  
> This project sometimes deviate from offical implementation in the book. For better conformance with Swift feature and standard paractice. I also made an effort to make this project more extensible, since I intend to use this as foundation for future project.

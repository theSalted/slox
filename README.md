[![Swift](https://github.com/theSalted/slox/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/theSalted/slox/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

Yet another Swift Implementation of a Lox Interpreter.

This project follows the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) written by [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob).

> [!NOTE]  
> This project sometimes deviate from offical implementation in the book. For better conformance with Swift feature and standard paractice. I also made an effort to make this project more extensible, since I intend to use this as foundation for future project. 

## Progress
- [x] Scanner
  - [x] Tests
  - [x] `\**\` style comments
- [ ] Abstract syntax tree generator

## Reference
- [Original Implementation](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)
- The [slox](https://github.com/alexito4/slox) implementation I referenced.
